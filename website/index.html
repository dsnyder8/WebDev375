    <p class="tft-text">
      <strong>Teamfight Tactics</strong> is a turn-based auto battler computer
      game. An auto battler, also known as auto chess, is a subgenre of strategy
      video games that feature chess-like elements where players place
      characters on a grid-shaped battlefield during a preparation phase, who
      then fight the opposing team's characters without any further direct input
      from the player. The aim of the game is to be the last one left alive from
      8 players, with each player starting with 100 health points. It is split
      into multiple stages, with 5 rounds each stage. Each round you battle
      against a single opponent. The board is similar to that of a chess board,
      upon which you create your ‘team’. Like chess, you have multiple pieces.
      The number of pieces, or characters you have on your board at once
      corresponds to your level, starting at level 3 and ending at 9. Each
      character has a trait that can synergise with other traits in the game.
      Like in Poker, if you have 5 hearts you have a strong hand. The objective
      is to build a team of characters that work well with each other. A
      successful team will utilise the traits that work best with one another
      and that successfully counter the opposition. To obtain these characters
      you must purchase them from the ‘shop’ that shows a limited number of
      options, but refreshes these options each round for free.
